This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in VHDL: improper initialization of internal signals.  The `bug.vhdl` file contains code with the flawed initialization.  The `bugSolution.vhdl` provides the corrected code.  Improper initialization can lead to unpredictable results, especially in designs with complex state machines or asynchronous processes.  Always ensure signals are initialized to valid values that align with their intended use.
